## Development server

Run `ng serve` for the dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

If you do not have Angular in your development environment you may have to run the folllowing:
```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
npm install --save-dev @angular-devkit/build-angular
```
