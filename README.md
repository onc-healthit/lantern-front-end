# lantern-front-end

# Directions for Running
*  Running the front-end by itself requires running using the angular-cli
<br> * [Link to the Angular CLI Readme](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/packages/angular/cli/README.md)
<br> * You can install it with the command `npm install -g @angular/cli` which will install it globally on your computer
<br> * This requires having Node 8.9+ and NPM 5.5.1+, so you'll have to install those if you don't have them already
*  From the root of the project, where this file is located, run `npm install`
<br> * This installs all of the node modules needed based on the package.json
<br> * You could also install yarn and run `yarn install` instead, which is basically just a faster npm
*  Now you can run `ng serve`, and the default project should appear at `http://localhost:4200/`
